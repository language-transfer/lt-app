This app is developed in React Native, and is designed to work with both iOS & Android platforms.

### Goals

The Language Transfer app should be:

- 100% free, like the Language Transfer courses
- Accessible and easy to use for the visually impaired
- Considerate of users in areas with poor network quality, expensive Internet access, or low-end devices
- Free of distractions and annoyances, like advertisements or superfluous notifications
- Self-sustaining: maintainable and easy to build even in the absence of the original maintainers
- Private by design, sharing only anonymous usage statistics
